From this data we were able to pull some stock prices and able to come up with recent daily returns and volatility. We ran a monte carlo simulation to come up with projected returns with investments. Below are the graphs that came up with some projected data.

This is the Monte Carlo Simulation based on a 60/40 split of SPY AND AGG for 30 years.
